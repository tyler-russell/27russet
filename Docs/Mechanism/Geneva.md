# Geneva Mechanism
## Overview 
A Geneva Mechanism is a gear system that converts constant rotary motion into intermittent rotary motion. It is made up of a driving wheel with one or more pins and a driven wheel called a Geneva wheel with slots that the pins slide into. When the pin enters a slide, it rotates the Geneva wheel by a fixed angle which can be found by dividing 360 by the number of slides on the wheel, then disengages while the wheel remains stationary. This mechanism is commonly used in film projectors to advance film one frame at a time between periods of rest. The design ensures precise frameworks and reliable stopping positions. Geneva mechanisms are valued in applications that need accurate, repeated rotational positioning.

I had to learn how to use Fusion Joints in order to create the motion set for this design. At first I tried animating the motion but later found out that was not what I was suppose to do for this project and I had to start over. I made both the pin wheel and the Geneva wheel have revolute joints around their center points and enabled contact sets between all of the components so that they all obyed the laws of physics and would not just pass through each other. 
## Assembled Final Design 

## What I learned 
I learned how the Geneva mechanism produces intermittent rotational motion by precisely controlling the contact between the drive pin and the Geneva wheel slots. I gained experience using revolute joints and contact sets in Fusion 360 to accurately simulate complex motion and non-moving periods. This project also taught me the importance of correct joint selection over simple animation to ensure physically and more accurate kinematic behavior that models the real world.
