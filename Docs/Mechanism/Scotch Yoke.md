# Scotch Yoke 
## Overview 
The Scotch yoke is a mechanism that converts rotary motion into linear back and forth motion, or vice versa. It consists of a rotating crank with a pin that slides within a slotted yoke, causing the yoke to move back and forth in a straight line. Unlike a slider-crank mechanism, the Scotch yoke produces perfect simple motion with no wobbling displacement. This mechanism is used in control valves, mechanical testing machines, and some steam engines. The design offers high mechanical efficiency and small size compared to other motion conversion systems. However, it experiences high sliding friction and wear at the yoke-slot interface.

I made the pin wheel have a revolute joint so it could spin whilst giving the yoke a sliding joint so it could only move in a linear fashion. Of course contact sets remained on.
