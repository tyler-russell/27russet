# Four Bar Linkage 
## Overview 
Four-Bar Linkage A four-bar linkage is one of the simplest and most versatile mechanisms in mechanical engineering, being made up of four rigid bars connected by pin joints. The mechanism has one fixed bar (the ground link) and three moving bars that create various motion patterns depending on their lengths compared to one another. Four-bar linkages can produce rocking, rotating, or complex circular linear motion depending on their design choices. They are classified into types like crank-rocker, double-crank, and double-rocker based on which links can rotate 360 degrees. These linkages are found everywhere from car suspension systems and windshield wipers to robotic arms and industrial machinery. The condition of the comparative length determines whether a four-bar linkage will have continuous rotation or only oscillating motion.

I made all the pin joints have revolution joints but constricted the base joints to not being able to spin 360 degrees to provide a different type of four back linkage: a double-rocker mechanism. Of course contact sets remained on.

## What I learned
I learned how link length and ground constraints to determine the mobility and classification of a four-bar linkage, specifically how limiting joint rotation can produce a double-rocker mechanism. I gained experience applying revolute joints and motion constraints in Fusion 360 to accurately simulate the kinematic behavior. This project also reinforced the importance of contact sets, group components that do not move, and joint limits in achieving the perfect mechanical motion without over-constraining the system.
