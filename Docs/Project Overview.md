# Project Overview
The goal of this project was to pick 3 mechanisms from the video (Cam Mechanism, Geneva Mechanism, Ratchet & Pawl, Oldham Coupling, Four-Bar Linkage, Scotch Yoke), model it in Fusion 360, create a motion set in Fusion, 3D print and assemble. 3D parts will turn with handle or motor. A written  paragraph should be included about each mechanism and it application in real world engineering

Below is the embedded Youtube video where I learned about the three mechanisms I would need to use.
