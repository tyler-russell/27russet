# Welcome to my Engineering in Motion Final Project Site

Hello! My name is Tyler Russell and you are currently on my documentation website where I will detail to you exactly what I did for my final project of Engineering in Motion for the first semester of my junior year in high school. Part of that project was learning, creating, and publishing this site to the internet where it will hopefully get some attention by anyone interested. Thank you.
