# Welcome to My Engineering in Motion Final Project Site

Hello! My name is **Tyler Russell**, and this website documents my **Engineering in Motion Final Project** from the first semester of my junior year in high school.

This project showcases the engineering concepts, mechanisms, and design process I learned throughout the course. Part of the assignment was also to **design, build, and publish a website**, which you are currently viewing.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!
